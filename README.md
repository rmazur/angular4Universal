# Angular 4+ Universal and SEO Starter Template
# angular4Universal

This project is based on the [Angular 4 Universal and SEO Tutorial]

Feel free to clone this repo as a quick way to get up and running with an Universal and SEO-ready, Angular CLI-ready, Angular 4+ project.

Simply clone the repo, run `npm install` in the project directory, then `npm run start`

I also created a Docker image containing this sample app
